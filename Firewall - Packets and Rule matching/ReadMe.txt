source code name is lab5.py

File containing the rules, along with the file containing packets are stored in the same directory.
If you want to perform a test then you also have to place the file in the working directory.

following is the command to run the code :

  python lab5.py rf1.txt pf1.txt

  here rf1.txt is the name of the file containing the rules.
  pf1.txt is the name of the file containing the packets.

  So, the first argument will always be the RuleFilename and second one will be the PacketFilename.

If you to store the output in a file then use the following command (Windows) :

  python lab5.py rf1.txt pf1.txt > out.txt

  this will store the results in out.txt in current working directory.

Thank you.
