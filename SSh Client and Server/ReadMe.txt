The objective of this was to implement the functionality of an SSH client and an SSH server using the
socket interface and needed crytographic routines.

Ip address and port number on which the server is running will be shown on the terminal.

client.py is present in the directory ClientDir.

Things to consider while running cp and mv commands when asked :
  if you have given the filename then no need to give it in source and destination
  The file will copied with the same name in destination directory as in the source.
  eg : if file name in source is Blah.txt then the copied file in destination will also be of name Blah.txt

  points to note while inserting source and destination :
    if the path to the directory is D:/NetworkSecurity/Lab4 the you have to input D:/NetworkSecurity/Lab4/
    (Remember to add "slash")
